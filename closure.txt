                       Closure
Definition
           A closure is when a function is inside another function, and the inner function can still use the outer functionâ€™s variables, even after the outer function has finished running.
           Closure is been introduced to eliminate counter dilemma.(CD) means we use a global variable name as counter and access it from different function

Disadvantage:
           The value of the global variable can be changed which may affect the output of the function

Note
        1. Global and local variable are different even we modify any one it does not affect other
        2. A variable without any of this keyword(let,var,const) is global variable

Syntax:
            Function num() {
                      number=10
             }
             Function num1() {
                      console.log(number);
             }
             
  Example:   
                 A simple example is num1() can able to access the number variable but the Important it gain access only num() after it has been  executed
